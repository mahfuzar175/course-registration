## Features

### 1. Course Selection and Cart

Users can browse through the list of available courses and select one by clicking the "Select" button. The selected course's title, credit, and price are then displayed in the cart on the right-hand side. Users can only select one course at a time, and the cart shows the total credit hours and total price of the selected course(s).

### 2. Credit Hours Validation

As users select courses, the system tracks the total credit hours in the cart. If the total credit hours exceed the maximum limit (e.g., 20 hours), an error message is displayed.

### 3. Total Price Calculation

Calculate and display the total price of the selected courses in the cart. Whenever a course is selected or deselected, update the total price accordingly. Ensure that the user can see the cost of their selected courses at all times.

These features provide a basic but functional course registration system with validation
